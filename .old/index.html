       	 FSMK Lab Manual is an attempt to come up with documentation which helps in migrating labs in colleges completely to Free Software. As part of this, we have selected VTU's Computer Science Department and have come up with complete lab manual for all the labs that are conducted as part of the course.

      FSMK conducted a documentation workshop for college faculty members where they all could come together and help us produce this lab manual. It was a 3 day residential documentation workshop jointly organized with Jnana Vikas Institute of Technology, Bidadi at their campus from 23 January, 2014. It was attended by 16 faculty members of different colleges and 40 volunteers from FSMK. The documentation workshop was sponsored by Spoken Tutorial Project, an initiative by Government of India to promote IT literacy through Open Source software. Spoken Tutorials are very good learning material to learn about various Free Software tools and hence the videos are excellent companion to this Lab Manual. The videos themselves are released under Creative Commons license, so students can easily download them and share it with others. We would highly recommend our students to go through the Spoken Tutorials while using this Lab Manual and web links to the respective spoken tutorials are shared within the lab manual also.
